# Prometheus

Welcome to my promethus project. The code in this repository will form the foundation for a more ambitious project but before we can begin that, we need a framework of libraries and helper classes.

These helper classes/libraries include:
* Math libs (scalar & vector)
* Threading libs
  * Threadpool
  * Fibers
  * Synchronisation primitives
* Memory Allocators
* Logging
* FileIO/Serialisation/Streams
* Random number generators
